<p> Denne sang hedder: What makes you beautiful</p>
<p1> 
    "You're insecure, don't know what for
    You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
    Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
    Bein' the way that you are is enough
    </p1>
    <p2>
        Everyone else in the room can see it
        Everyone else but you</p2>

        <p3>
            Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
            The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
            But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
            If only you saw what I can see
            You'll understand why I want you so desperately
            Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
            That's what makes you beautiful!"
            </p3>
